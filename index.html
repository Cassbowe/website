    <p class="paragraph1">These Fabulous thieves are the ones who will be taking on this mission to steal your prized possession. From left to right we have Panther, Joker, and Skull. Panther is an amazing distractor, she allows both Joker and Skull to get in and be able to do their jobs a lot easier. Joker is the leader of The Phantom Thieves, as strong as he is stylish, nothing will stop him from getting what he wants. Skull is the real strength of the group, though he isnt as elegant or as stylish as Panther, and Joker, he is still a real force to be recokend with. </p>
